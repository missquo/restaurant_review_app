## Introduction

The object of this project is to gain practice converting a static webpage into a responsive design that is both desktop- and mobile-ready, as well as to add accessibility to the site for screen reader use.  In addition, a service worker should be added to begin the process of increasing offline access to the site.

## Dependencies

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).  Service worker code relies heavily on help from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s [Offline First Course](https://in.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899).

## Try It Yourself

The starting code provided by Udacity is available on their [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git).
